    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hereâ€™s a quick and easy chicken enchiladas recipe that makes enough to feed a hungry family. The secret is the flavorful seasoning blend and preparation of the chicken before rolling them in the tortillas.</p>
    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless boneless chicken breast</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons cumin powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Mexican Spice Blend</li>
      <li>1 red onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 cup frozen corn, thawed</li>
      <li>5 canned whole green chiles, seeded and coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>4 canned chipotle chiles, seeded and minced</li>
      <li>1 (28-ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>16 corn tortillas</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups enchilada sauce, canned</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar and Jack cheeses</li>
      <li>Garnish: chopped cilantro leaves, chopped scallions, sour cream, chopped tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Coat large saute pan with oil. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Brown chicken over medium heat, allow 7 minutes each side or until no longer pink. Sprinkle chicken with cumin, garlic powder and Mexican spices before turning. Remove chicken to a platter, allow to cool. </li>
      <li>Saute onion and garlic in chicken drippings until tender. Add corn and chiles. Stir well to combine. Add canned tomatoes, saute 1 minute. </li>
      <li>Pull chicken breasts apart by hand into shredded strips. Add shredded chicken to saute pan, combine with vegetables. Dust the mixture with flour to help set. </li>
      <li>Microwave tortillas on high for 30 seconds. This softens them and makes them more pliable. Coat the bottom of 2 (13 by 9-inch) pans with a ladle of enchilada sauce. Using a large shallow bowl, dip each tortilla in enchilada sauce to lightly coat. Spoon 1/4 cup chicken mixture in each tortilla. Fold over filling, place 8 enchiladas in each pan with seam side down. Top with remaining enchilada sauce and cheese. </li>
      <li>Bake for 15 minutes in a preheated 350 degree F oven until cheese melts. Garnish with cilantro, scallion, sour cream and chopped tomatoes before serving. Serve with Spanish rice and beans. </li>
    </ol>
